# Evaluation for MultiView detection

## Preparation

Follow the installation guide for [matlab-engine](https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-matlab-engine-api-for-python-in-nondefault-locations.html).

e.g. 

```shell script
cd /usr/local/MATLAB/R2019a/extern/engines/python
python setup.py build --build-base="/home/houyz/matlab/" install --prefix="/home/houyz/miniconda3"
```

## Run

ground truth file: ```gt.txt``` should be auto-generated if you call the dataset class.

detection result file: should also be auto-generated by the ```trainer.test(dataloader, res_fpath)``` function.

    - The first column in .csv file should be frame number from 0 to 1995 in step of 5
    - The second and third column should be x and y coordinate, which are from the world grid [480,1440].
